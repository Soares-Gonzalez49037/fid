<h1>About Jen&rsquo;s Kitchen </h1>
<div class="boxed"><p class="strong">The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. <i>Bon Appetit!</i></p><p class="strong">The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.</p><p class="strong">If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at jen@example.com.</p></div>
