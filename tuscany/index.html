<h2>Pozzarello</h2>
<p><a href="window.html"><img src="thumbnails/window_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the bedroom window" width="75" height="100"></a> The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year 1200 as the home of the gardner who tended the grounds of the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view from our bedroom window.</p>

<h2><a href="countryside.html"><img src="thumbnails/countryside_thumb.jpg" alt="The beautiful fields and hills of the Tuscan countryside" width="75" height="100"></a>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
<p>This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot like the scene on the way to Sienna, and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We were surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of our travels.</p>

<h2><a href="sienna.html"><img src="thumbnails/sienna_thumb.jpg" alt="Every day was leg day with all of the steep streets" width="75" height="100"></a>Sienna</h2>
<p>The closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many days exploring the steep and crooked streets, sampling the local cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape the sun.</p>
